# AI-Projects
A collection of AI Langchain experiments including an AI voice assistant and Conversational Memory retrieval.

Models
Make sure to insert your own local model into the models folder and redirect the path to the models in your own file system.
Be warned that 12B models and above can put strain on your computer and may end up being slower than the smaller models.

Requirements
Since this file is experimental most of the requirements can be found in the Scripts folder but when the projects are complete will be deleted and compiled in an organised requirements.txt 
since alot of the scripts will be outdated or obselete. Play around with updating certain project libraries to ensure that the project works.
